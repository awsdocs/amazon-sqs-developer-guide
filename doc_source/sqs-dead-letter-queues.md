# Amazon SQS dead\-letter queues<a name="sqs-dead-letter-queues"></a>

Amazon SQS supports *dead\-letter queues* \(DLQ\), which other queues \(*source queues*\) can target for messages that can't be processed \(consumed\) successfully\. Dead\-letter queues are useful for debugging your application or messaging system because they let you isolate unconsumed messages to determine why their processing doesn't succeed\. For information about creating a queue and configuring a dead\-letter queue for it using the Amazon SQS console, see [Configuring a dead\-letter queue \(console\)](sqs-configure-dead-letter-queue.md)\. Once you have debugged the consumer application or the consumer application is available to consume the message, you can use the [**dead\-letter queue redrive capability**](sqs-configure-dead-letter-queue-redrive.md) to move the messages back to the source queue with just a click of a button on the Amazon SQS console\.

**Important**  
Amazon SQS does *not* create the dead\-letter queue automatically\. You must first create the queue before using it as a dead\-letter queue\.

## How do dead\-letter queues work?<a name="sqs-dead-letter-queues-how-they-work"></a>

Sometimes, messages can't be processed because of a variety of possible issues, such as erroneous conditions within the producer or consumer application or an unexpected state change that causes an issue with your application code\. For example, if a user places a web order with a particular product ID, but the product ID is deleted, the web store's code fails and displays an error, and the message with the order request is sent to a dead\-letter queue\.

Occasionally, producers and consumers might fail to interpret aspects of the protocol that they use to communicate, causing message corruption or loss\. Also, the consumer's hardware errors might corrupt message payload\. 

The *redrive policy* specifies the *source queue*, the *dead\-letter queue*, and the conditions under which Amazon SQS moves messages from the former to the latter if the consumer of the source queue fails to process a message a specified number of times\. The `maxReceiveCount` is the number of times a consumer tries receiving a message from a queue without deleting it before being moved to the dead\-letter queue\. Setting the `maxReceiveCount` to a low value such as 1 would result in any failure to receive a message to cause the message to be moved to the dead\-letter queue\. Such failures include network errors and client dependency errors\. To ensure that your system is resilient against errors, set the `maxReceiveCount` high enough to allow for sufficient retries\.

The *redrive allow policy* specifies which source queues can access the dead\-letter queue\. This policy applies to a potential dead\-letter queue\. You can choose whether to allow all source queues, allow specific source queues, or deny all source queues\. The default is to allow all source queues to use the dead\-letter queue\. If you choose to allow specific queues \(using the `byQueue` option\), you can specify up to 10 source queues using the source queue Amazon Resource Name \(ARN\)\. If you specify `denyAll`, the queue cannot be used as a dead\-letter queue\.

To specify a dead\-letter queue, you can use the console or the AWS SDK for Java\. You must do this for each queue that sends messages to a dead\-letter queue\. Multiple queues of the same type can target a single dead\-letter queue\. For more information, see [Configuring a dead\-letter queue \(console\)](sqs-configure-dead-letter-queue.md) and the `RedrivePolicy` and `RedriveAllowPolicy` attributes of the [https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/APIReference/API_CreateQueue.html#API_CreateQueue_RequestParameters](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/APIReference/API_CreateQueue.html#API_CreateQueue_RequestParameters) or [https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/APIReference/API_SetQueueAttributes.html#API_SetQueueAttributes_RequestParameters](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/APIReference/API_SetQueueAttributes.html#API_SetQueueAttributes_RequestParameters) action\.

**Important**  
The dead\-letter queue of a FIFO queue must also be a FIFO queue\. Similarly, the dead\-letter queue of a standard queue must also be a standard queue\.  
You must use the same AWS account to create the dead\-letter queue and the other queues that send messages to the dead\-letter queue\. Also, dead\-letter queues must reside in the same region as the other queues that use the dead\-letter queue\. For example, if you create a queue in the US East \(Ohio\) region and you want to use a dead\-letter queue with that queue, the second queue must also be in the US East \(Ohio\) region\.  
The expiration of a message is always based on its original enqueue timestamp\. When a message is moved to a dead\-letter queue, the enqueue timestamp is unchanged\. The `ApproximateAgeOfOldestMessage` metric indicates when the message moved to the dead\-letter queue, *not* when the message was originally sent\. For example, assume that a message spends 1 day in the original queue before it's moved to a dead\-letter queue\. If the dead\-letter queue's retention period is 4 days, the message is deleted from the dead\-letter queue after 3 days and the `ApproximateAgeOfOldestMessage` is 3 days\. Thus, it is a best practice to always set the retention period of a dead\-letter queue to be longer than the retention period of the original queue\.

## What are the benefits of dead\-letter queues?<a name="sqs-dead-letter-queues-benefits"></a>

The main task of a dead\-letter queue is to handle the lifecycle of unconsumed messages\. A dead\-letter queue lets you set aside and isolate messages that can't be processed correctly to determine why their processing didn't succeed\. Setting up a dead\-letter queue allows you to do the following:
+ Configure an alarm for any messages moved to a dead\-letter queue\.
+ Examine logs for exceptions that might have caused messages to be moved to a dead\-letter queue\.
+ Analyze the contents of messages moved to a dead\-letter queue to diagnose software or the producer's or consumer's hardware issues\.
+ Determine whether you have given your consumer sufficient time to process messages\.

## How do different queue types handle message failure?<a name="sqs-dead-letter-queues-handling-message-failure"></a>

### Standard queues<a name="dead-letter-queues-standard-queues"></a>

[Standard queues](standard-queues.md) keep processing messages until the expiration of the retention period\. This continuous processing of messages minimizes the chances of having your queue blocked by messages that can't be processed\. Continuous message processing also provides faster recovery for your queue\.

In a system that processes thousands of messages, having a large number of messages that the consumer repeatedly fails to acknowledge and delete might increase costs and place extra load on the hardware\. Instead of trying to process failing messages until they expire, it is better to move them to a dead\-letter queue after a few processing attempts\.

**Note**  
Standard queues allow a high number of inflight messages\. If the majority of your messages can't be consumed and aren't sent to a dead\-letter queue, your rate of processing valid messages can slow down\. Thus, to maintain the efficiency of your queue, make sure that your application correctly handles message processing\.

### FIFO queues<a name="dead-letter-queues-FIFO-queues"></a>

[FIFO queues](FIFO-queues.md) provide exactly\-once processing by consuming messages in sequence from a message group\. Thus, although the consumer can continue to retrieve ordered messages from another message group, the first message group remains unavailable until the message blocking the queue is processed successfully\.

**Note**  
FIFO queues allow a lower number of inflight messages\. Thus, to keep your FIFO queue from getting blocked by a message, make sure that your application correctly handles message processing\.

## When should I use a dead\-letter queue?<a name="sqs-dead-letter-queues-when-to-use"></a>

![\[Image NOT FOUND\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/SQSDeveloperGuide/images/checkmark.png)Do use dead\-letter queues with standard queues\. You should always take advantage of dead\-letter queues when your applications don't depend on ordering\. Dead\-letter queues can help you troubleshoot incorrect message transmission operations\.

**Note**  
Even when you use dead\-letter queues, you should continue to monitor your queues and retry sending messages that fail for transient reasons\.

![\[Image NOT FOUND\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/SQSDeveloperGuide/images/checkmark.png)Do use dead\-letter queues to decrease the number of messages and to reduce the possibility of exposing your system to *poison\-pill messages* \(messages that can be received but can't be processed\)\.

![\[Image NOT FOUND\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/SQSDeveloperGuide/images/checkmark.png)Do use a dead\-letter queue with a FIFO queue if you don't want to break the exact order of messages or operations\. For example, don't use a dead\-letter queue with instructions in an Edit Decision List \(EDL\) for a video editing suite, where changing the order of edits changes the context of subsequent edits\.

![\[Image NOT FOUND\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/SQSDeveloperGuide/images/cross.png)Don't use a dead\-letter queue with standard queues when you want to be able to keep retrying the transmission of a message indefinitely\. For example, don't use a dead\-letter queue if your program must wait for a dependent process to become active or available\.


## Moving messages out of a dead\-letter queue<a name="sqs-dead-letter-queues-redrive"></a>

Dead\-letter queue redrive allows you to manage the life cycle of unconsumed messages by moving standard unconsumed messages out of a dead\-letter queue back to its source queue\(s\)\. Optionally, you can also investigate the message attributes and related metadata available for unconsumed messages in the dead\-letter queue\. Dead\-letter queue redrive is an asynchronous workflow\. It only redrives the messages that are available in the dead\-letter queue at the time user initiates the redrive task\. If new messages are added to the dead\-letter queue, the user can initiate another redrive task once the previous task is completed\.

The redrive task uses Amazon SQS's `SendMessageBatch`, `ReceiveMessage`, and `DeleteMessageBatch` APIs on behalf of the user to redrive the messages\. Therefore, all redriven messages are considered new messages with a new `messageid`, `enqueueTime`, and retention period\. The pricing of dead\-letter queue redrive uses the number of API calls invoked and bills based on the [Amazon SQS pricing](http://aws.amazon.com/sqs/pricing)\. Since Amazon SQS batches the messages while redriving them from the dead\-letter queues to the source queues, it makes the dead\-letter queue redrive to source queues a low\-cost and straightforward option for users to move messages from dead\-letter queues easily\.

![\[Image NOT FOUND\]](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/SQSDeveloperGuide/images/sqs-dead-letter-queue-redrive-diagram.png)

By default, dead\-letter queue redrive moves messages from a dead\-letter queue to a source queue\. However, you can also configure any other standard queue as the redrive destination\. Additionally, you can configure the redrive velocity to set the rate at which Amazon SQS moves messages\. For instructions about configuring a dead\-letter queue redrive using the Amazon SQS console, see [Configuring a dead\-letter queue redrive \(console\)](sqs-configure-dead-letter-queue-redrive.md)\.

**Note**  
Amazon SQS supports dead\-letter queue redrive only for standard queues in the Amazon SQS console\.  
Amazon SQS doesn't support filtering and modifying messages while redriving them from the dead\-letter queue\.  
  
A dead\-letter queue redrive task can run a maximum of 36 hours\. Amazon SQS supports a maximum of 100 active redrive tasks per account\.

## Troubleshooting dead\-letter queues<a name="sqs-dead-letter-queues-troubleshooting"></a>

In some cases, Amazon SQS dead\-letter queues might not always behave as expected\. This section gives an overview of common issues and shows how to resolve them\.

### Viewing messages using the console might cause messages to be moved to a dead\-letter queue<a name="sqs-dlq-console"></a>

Amazon SQS counts viewing a message in the console against the corresponding queue's redrive policy\. Thus, if you view a message in the console the number of times specified in the corresponding queue's redrive policy, the message is moved to the corresponding queue's dead\-letter queue\.

To adjust this behavior, you can do one of the following:
+ Increase the **Maximum Receives** setting for the corresponding queue's redrive policy\.
+ Avoid viewing the corresponding queue's messages in the console\.

### The `NumberOfMessagesSent` and `NumberOfMessagesReceived` for a dead\-letter queue don't match<a name="sqs-dlq-number-of-messages"></a>

If you send a message to a dead\-letter queue manually, it is captured by the `NumberOfMessagesSent` metric\. However, if a message is sent to a dead\-letter queue as a result of a failed processing attempt, it isn't captured by this metric\. Thus, it is possible for the values of `NumberOfMessagesSent` and `NumberOfMessagesReceived` to be different\.

### For information about creating and configuring a dead\-letter queue redrive using the Amazon SQS console<a name="sqs-dlq-redrive-permissions"></a>

Note that the dead\-letter queue redrive requires you to set appropriate permissions for Amazon SQS to receive messages from the dead\-letter queue and send messages to the destination queue\. In case of insufficient permissions, the dead\-letter queue redrive to the source queue does not initiate the message redrive and can fail the task\. You can view the status of your message redrive task to remediate the issues and try again\.

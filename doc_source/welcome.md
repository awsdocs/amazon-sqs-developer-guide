# What is Amazon Simple Queue Service?<a name="welcome"></a>

Amazon Simple Queue Service \(Amazon SQS\) offers a secure, durable, and available hosted queue that lets you integrate and decouple distributed software systems and components\. Amazon SQS offers common constructs such as [dead\-letter queues](sqs-dead-letter-queues.md) and [cost allocation tags](sqs-queue-tags.md)\. It provides a generic web services API and it can be accessed by any programming language that the AWS SDK supports\.

Amazon SQS supports both [standard](standard-queues.md) and [FIFO queues](FIFO-queues.md)\. For more information, see [Queue types](#sqs-queue-types)

## Benefits of using Amazon SQS<a name="sqs-benefits"></a>
+ **Security** – [You control](sqs-authentication-and-access-control.md) who can send messages to and receive messages from an Amazon SQS queue\.

  [Server\-side encryption \(SSE\)](sqs-server-side-encryption.md) lets you transmit sensitive data by protecting the contents of messages in queues using keys managed in AWS Key Management Service \(AWS KMS\)\.
+ **Durability** – To ensure the safety of your messages, Amazon SQS stores them on multiple servers\. Standard queues support [at\-least\-once message delivery](standard-queues.md#standard-queues-at-least-once-delivery), and FIFO queues support [exactly\-once message processing](FIFO-queues.md#FIFO-queues-exactly-once-processing)\.
+ **Availability** – Amazon SQS uses [redundant infrastructure](sqs-basic-architecture.md) to provide highly\-concurrent access to messages and high availability for producing and consuming messages\. 
+ **Scalability** – Amazon SQS can process each [buffered request](sqs-client-side-buffering-request-batching.md) independently, scaling transparently to handle any load increases or spikes without any provisioning instructions\.
+ **Reliability** – Amazon SQS locks your messages during processing, so that multiple producers can send and multiple consumers can receive messages at the same time\. 
+ **Customization** – Your queues don't have to be exactly alike—for example, you can [set a default delay on a queue](sqs-delay-queues.md)\. You can store the contents of messages larger than 256 KB [using Amazon Simple Storage Service \(Amazon S3\)](sqs-s3-messages.md) or Amazon DynamoDB, with Amazon SQS holding a pointer to the Amazon S3 object, or you can split a large message into smaller messages\.

## Differences between Amazon SQS, Amazon MQ, and Amazon SNS<a name="sqs-difference-from-amazon-mq-sns"></a>

Amazon SQS and [Amazon SNS](https://aws.amazon.com/sns/) are queue and topic services that are highly scalable, simple to use, and don't require you to set up message brokers\. We recommend these services for new applications that can benefit from nearly unlimited scalability and simple APIs\.

[Amazon MQ](https://aws.amazon.com/amazon-mq/) is a managed message broker service that provides compatibility with many popular message brokers\. We recommend Amazon MQ for migrating applications from existing message brokers that rely on compatibility with APIs such as JMS or protocols such as AMQP, MQTT, OpenWire, and STOMP\.

## Queue types<a name="sqs-queue-types"></a>

The following table describes the capabilities of standard queues and FIFO queues\.


| Standard queue | FIFO queue | 
| --- | --- | 
|  **Unlimited Throughput** – Standard queues support a nearly unlimited number of API calls per second, per API action \(`SendMessage`, `ReceiveMessage`, or `DeleteMessage`\)\. **At\-Least\-Once Delivery** – A message is delivered at least once, but occasionally more than one copy of a message is delivered\. **Best\-Effort Ordering** – Occasionally, messages will be delivered in an order different from which they were sent\.  | High Throughput – If you use [batching](sqs-batch-api-actions.md), FIFO queues support up to 3,000 transactions per second, per API method \(SendMessageBatch, ReceiveMessage, or DeleteMessageBatch\)\. The 3000 transactions represent 300 API calls, each with a batch of 10 messages\. To request a quota increase, [submit a support request](https://console.aws.amazon.com/support/home#/case/create?issueType=service-limit-increase&limitType=service-code-sqs)\. Without batching, FIFO queues support up to 300 API calls per second, per API method \(SendMessage, ReceiveMessage, or DeleteMessage\)\. **Exactly\-Once Processing** – A message is delivered once and remains available until a consumer processes and deletes it\. Duplicates aren't introduced into the queue\.**First\-In\-First\-Out Delivery** – The order in which messages are sent and received is strictly preserved\. |

## Pricing for Amazon SQS<a name="sqs-pricing"></a>

Amazon SQS has no upfront costs\. The first million monthly requests are free\. After that, you pay based on the number and content of requests, and the interactions with Amazon S3 and the AWS Key Management Service\. 

For information, see [Amazon SQS pricing](https://aws.amazon.com/sqs/pricing/)\.
